<title>Pedagogical Foundation</title>
<para id="fs-id1165039196055">Throughout <emphasis effect="italics">University Physics</emphasis> you will find derivations of concepts that present classical ideas and techniques, as well as modern applications and methods. Most chapters start with observations or experiments that place the material in a context of physical experience. Presentations and explanations rely on years of classroom experience on the part of long-time physics professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students. Throughout the text, links enable students to review earlier material and then return to the present discussion, reinforcing connections between topics. Key historical figures and experiments are discussed in the main text (rather than in boxes or sidebars), maintaining a focus on the development of physical intuition. Key ideas, definitions, and equations are highlighted in the text and listed in summary form at the end of each chapter. Examples and chapter-opening images often include contemporary applications from daily life or modern science and engineering that students can relate to, from smart phones to the internet to GPS devices.</para>

<title>Assessments That Reinforce Key Concepts</title>
<para id="fs-id1165039247386">In-chapter <emphasis effect="bold">Examples</emphasis> generally follow a three-part format of Strategy, Solution, and Significance to emphasize how to approach a problem, how to work with the equations, and how to check and generalize the result. Examples are often followed by <emphasis effect="bold">Check Your Understanding</emphasis> questions and answers to help reinforce for students the important ideas of the examples. <emphasis effect="bold">Problem-Solving Strategies</emphasis> in each chapter break down methods of approaching various types of problems into steps students can follow for guidance. The book also includes exercises at the end of each chapter so students can practice what they’ve learned.</para>

<item><emphasis effect="bold">Conceptual questions</emphasis> do not require calculation but test student learning of the key concepts.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Problems</emphasis> categorized by section test student problem-solving skills and the ability to apply ideas to practical situations.</item>
<item><emphasis effect="bold">Additional Problems</emphasis> apply knowledge across the chapter, forcing students to identify what concepts and equations are appropriate for solving given problems. Randomly located throughout the problems are <emphasis effect="bold">Unreasonable Results</emphasis> exercises that ask students to evaluate the answer to a problem and explain why it is not reasonable and what assumptions made might not be correct.</item>
